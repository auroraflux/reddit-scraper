## 📖 How to Use

### Web Interface (Easiest)

1. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/start_server.sh
   ```

2. **Open in browser:**
   http://localhost:8001

3. **Paste any Reddit URL and click "Scrape Thread"**

   Examples that work:
   - `https://reddit.com/r/python/comments/...`
   - `https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/...`
   - `https://old.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/...`

   All automatically convert to old.reddit.com!

### API (For Programmatic Use)

#### Python Example
```python
import requests

# Scrape a thread
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8001/scrape",
    json={"url": "https://reddit.com/r/python/comments/..."}
)

data = response.json()

if data['success']:
    print(f"Title: {data['post']['title']}")
    print(f"Total comments: {data['stats']['total_comments']}")

    # Access comments
    for comment in data['comments']:
        print(f"• {comment['author']}: {comment['text']}")
        # Access replies
        for reply in comment['replies']:
            print(f"  └─ {reply['author']}: {reply['text']}")
```

#### cURL Example
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/scrape \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://reddit.com/r/macapps/comments/1of0wan/..."}' \
  | jq '.stats'

# Output:
# {
#   "total_comments": 37,
#   "top_level_comments": 13,
#   "max_depth": 5
# }
```

## 🤖 Perfect for LLM Context

### Use with Claude/ChatGPT

```python
import requests
import anthropic

# 1. Scrape Reddit thread
thread = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8001/scrape",
    json={"url": "https://reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/..."}
).json()

# 2. Format for LLM
context = f"""
Reddit Discussion: {thread['post']['title']}
Posted by u/{thread['post']['author']} ({thread['post']['score']} upvotes)

{thread['stats']['total_comments']} comments:

"""

# Add all comments in hierarchy
def format_comments(comments, depth=0):
    text = ""
    for c in comments:
        indent = "  " * depth
        text += f"\n{indent}• u/{c['author']} ({c['score']} pts): {c['text']}"
        if c['replies']:
            text += format_comments(c['replies'], depth + 1)
    return text

context += format_comments(thread['comments'])

# 3. Send to Claude
client = anthropic.Anthropic()
message = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
    max_tokens=2048,
    messages=[{
        "role": "user",
        "content": f"{context}\n\nSummarize the key insights from this discussion."
    }]
)

print(message.content)
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Server won't start
```bash
# Check if port 8001 is in use
lsof -i :8001

# Kill if needed
kill $(lsof -t -i :8001)

# Restart
./scripts/start_server.sh
```

### "Address already in use"
```bash
# Change port in reddit_scraper/server.py
# Find: uvicorn.run(..., port=8001)
# Change to: uvicorn.run(..., port=8002)
```

### Scraping fails
- Make sure URL is a post (not subreddit or user page)
- Check if post exists (not deleted)
- Can't scrape private subreddits

## 🎓 Advanced Examples

### Batch Scrape Multiple Threads
```python
import requests
import time

urls = [
    "https://reddit.com/r/python/comments/...",
    "https://reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/...",
]

threads = []
for url in urls:
    response = requests.post(
        "http://localhost:8001/scrape",
        json={"url": url}
    )

    if response.ok:
        threads.append(response.json())

    # Be respectful - wait between requests
    time.sleep(3)

print(f"Scraped {len(threads)} threads")
```

### Find Most Active Commenters
```python
def analyze_thread(thread_data):
    """Find most active users in a thread"""
    user_counts = {}

    def count_user(comments):
        for c in comments:
            user_counts[c['author']] = user_counts.get(c['author'], 0) + 1
            if c['replies']:
                count_user(c['replies'])

    count_user(thread_data['comments'])

    # Top 5
    top_users = sorted(user_counts.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)[:5]

    return top_users

thread = requests.post(...).json()
top = analyze_thread(thread)
print(f"Most active: {top[0][0]} with {top[0][1]} comments")
```
