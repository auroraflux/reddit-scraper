# Reddit Scraping Approaches

## This Tool: JSON API Scraping

This reddit-scraper tool uses Reddit's public JSON API for deterministic, complete extraction.

**Performance:**
```
Top-level comments: 13+
Total comments: 37+ (100% of visible comments)
Max depth: 5+ levels (unlimited)
Cost: $0.00 (FREE!)
Speed: 5-8 seconds
Accuracy: 100% (deterministic)
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ **FREE** - No API costs, no authentication
- ✅ **Fast** - 5-8 seconds per thread
- ✅ **Complete** - Gets 100% of comments
- ✅ **Unlimited nesting** - 5+ levels deep
- ✅ **Deterministic** - Always same results
- ✅ **Simple** - Just HTTP requests, no browser
- ✅ **Reliable** - Uses official Reddit JSON API

**Cons:**
- ❌ **Reddit only** - Doesn't work for other websites
- ❌ **Public data only** - Can't access private subreddits
- ❌ **No authentication** - Can't access user-specific content

## Alternative: LLM-Based Web Scraping

For **general web scraping** (not Reddit-specific), LLM-powered tools like Crawl4AI can extract structured data from any website.

**When to use LLM-based scraping:**
- Need to scrape websites other than Reddit
- Website has complex/dynamic structure
- Need semantic understanding of content
- Willing to pay small API costs (~$0.002/page)

**Trade-offs:**
- Costs API tokens (Gemini, OpenAI, etc.)
- Slower (10-15 seconds per page)
- May not get 100% of content (token limits)
- Less deterministic (LLM-based)

## Recommendation

**For Reddit scraping:** Use this tool (reddit-scraper)
- Free, fast, complete, reliable
- Purpose-built for Reddit's structure

**For general web scraping:** Use LLM-based tools
- More flexible for different websites
- Can handle complex page structures
- Good for sites without public APIs

This reddit-scraper tool is optimized specifically for Reddit and outperforms general-purpose scrapers for this use case.
